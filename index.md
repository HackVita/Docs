# Welcome to HackVita Documentation

The purpose of the API is to be able to integrate HackVita with other external services. The APIs are very simple and intuitive, obviously the [support](t.me/hackvitasupportbot) is always there in case of need.

### HackVita Terms

* Even by using this API, you MUST mention us in case of sharing the accounts generated.
* You MUST NOT exceed the limit of 1r/s or you will get banned from using the API.
* We deserve the right to ban anyone from the usage of this API if we consider him not suitable to this service.
* These Terms of Service could change over time.

### Who can use the API?

The API can, for the moment, only interact with the public and private generator, not for the shop. So you need to have purchased a plan from the official site.

### Security

Never share your API key with anyone. This way, you will give full access to the API. HackVita staff does not take any responsibility in such cases.
We reserve the right to save some information for the sole purpose of offering a better service.
